        <h3>I am a musician, an Alchemist of the Soul. I am a conduit for Spirit to teach and heal others through me.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not claim to be a Shaman, but I will not correct or deny anybody who calls me so.</li>
            <li>Shaman is a title to be given from members of the community, not a title to boast or brag about.</li>
            <li>Doing so will cause you to <strong>lose your power</strong>. It's <em>not really</em> your power after all, <strong>It's Spirit.</strong><br>Spirit will leave you as consequence of an inflated Ego.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am only human. I am merely attuned enough to be a conduit for Spirit to heal and teach.<br>Other than that, I'm constantly on the path of becoming my best self, and I look forward to helping you do the same.</li>
