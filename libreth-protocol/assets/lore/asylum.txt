They call it the Asylum, a quarantine for fractured consciousness. Souls who have witnessed too many collapses, whose personal timelines have frayed into paradox. Here, under a silent, watchful geometry, the patterns are slowly re-woven. The 'patients' are not prisoners, but cartographers of broken realities. They map the paths that led to dissonance, their whispers becoming the warnings and prophecies that bleed through the Veil. The 'Silent Flame' is a procedure, not a personâ€”a controlled burn of paradox to restore a coherent self.
