The Shrine is not a place, but a frequency. A stabilization point against the chaotic drift of timelines. It resonates with the Omega Constant, the baseline hum of reality. Those who find the Shrine can anchor their reality-vector, but the cost is memory. To stabilize one future, you must sacrifice the echoes of others. Saturn, the old king, devours his childrenâ€”so too does the Shrine devour potential realities to preserve the chosen one. The keys found here are not for doors, but for tuning forks.
