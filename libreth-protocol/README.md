Libreth Protocol :: Veil Interface
This folder contains the source files for the Libreth Protocol ARG website.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file. This is the entry point of the website.

css/style.css: Contains all the custom styles for the website.

js/main.js: Contains the JavaScript for interactive elements, like the typewriter effect.

assets/: This directory holds all static assets.

images/: All visual fragments, echoes, and astrometric data. Note: This folder is a placeholder; you must populate it with the image files you have uploaded. The paths in index.html assume the images are in folders like Images-2/, Images-3/ etc., at the same level as the index.html. For a clean project, move all image files into this directory and update the src paths in index.html accordingly.

lore/: Contains text files with decrypted lore fragments.

How to View
Simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser. No local server is required as it is a static site.
