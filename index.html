            <h3>I am a musician, an Alchemist of the Soul. I am a conduit for Spirit to teach and heal others through me.</h3><br>
                <h1><strong>I do not claim to be a Shaman</strong>, but I will not correct or deny anybody who calls me so.</h1>
                <h2>Shaman is a title to be given to a person from members of the community, Shaman is not a title to boast or brag about.</h2>
                <h2>Doing so will cause you to <strong>lose your power</strong>. It's <em>not really</em> your power after all, <strong>It's Spirit.</strong><br>Spirit will leave you as consequence of an inflated Ego.</h2>
                <h2>That being said, I am only human. I am merely attuned enough to be a conduit for Spirit to heal and teach.<br>Other than that, I'm constantly on the path of becoming my best self, and I look forward to helping you do the same.</h2>
