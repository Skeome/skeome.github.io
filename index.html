                    <h2>I do not claim to be a Shaman</h2>
                    <h3>However, I will not correct or deny anybody who calls me so.</h3>
                    <h2>Shaman is a title to be given from members of the community, not a title to boast or brag about.</h2>
                    <h3>Doing so will cause you to <strong>lose your power.</strong></h3><h4>It's <em>not really</em> your power after all, <strong>It's Spirit.</strong><br>Spirit will leave you as consequence of an inflated Ego.</h4><br>
                    <h3>That being said, <strong>I am only human.</strong><br><em>I am merely attuned enough to be a conduit for Spirit to heal and teach.</em><br>
                    <h4>Other than that, I'm constantly on the path of becoming my best self, and I look forward to helping you do the same.</h4>
