            <br><br><br><br><br>
            <h1>This is a safe space.</h1>
            <p>This is a place where judgement does not exist.<br>Anybody who seeks my service is welcome here.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Unlike every other healer out there, I work for free.</h1>
            <p>However, I do accept tips and donations.<br>
            <strong>(Gotta eat somehow, <em>right?</em>)</strong>
            <br>
            If you feel inclined to pay instead of tip or donate, pay what you think is right.
            <br>
            In other words, pay for the experience you recieve, not the experience you expect.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>I am here for you.</h1>
            <p1>If you reach out and I don't respond, don't hesitate to reach out again.<br>
            Sometimes mail gets lost, sometimes my notifications stop working.<br>
            I will never ignore anybody on purpose.</p1>
